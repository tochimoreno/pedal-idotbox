# pedal-idotbox

Este circuito forma parte de un proyecto de pasar a KiCAD circuitos de pedales de efectos para guitarra / bajo eléctrico.
Un poco para juntar este tipo de circuitos y otro poco para practicar el uso de KiCAD.

Tomo circuitos publicados en tagboardeffects, y los paso a KiCAD.

El esquemático lo levanto a mano de las Vero-board y los reviso varias veces, de todas formas está sujeto a errores.

## Text about de circuit
There are few manufacturers that raise an interest to simply go and get the original. I have no idea who the person behind Idiotbox is, but his designs, workmanship and artwork do please me to some degree. Plus his pricing seems to be on solid ground too. This one sounds particularly good. It has some wild distortion/fuzz tones for both, guitar and a bass...

This layout was originally based on a traced schematic by p.eat on FSB. That schematic had a few errors, which johnk helped to sort out. For this layout, i've subbed the parallel polarity protection for a series one and replaced the 10K JFET drain resistor with a 20K trimmer. This way you won't be able to kill your board with a reverse polarity and you'll be able to get everything you can out from that J201. JFET has also a 1M resistor path from gate to ground. This resistor isn't present in the original, but it will keep the JFET operation stable and it will not affect the sound.

A word about the original:
 The Idiotbox Blower Box Bass Distortion was designed with recreating the classic tone of Blacky from the early Voivod albums. It does everything from a mild grind to full-on massive distortion. It's awesome and you should have one…
